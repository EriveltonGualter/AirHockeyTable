# Air Hockey Table 

When I was studying at Western Michigan University during the Summer of 2014 with Professor Steven Durbin, I took a class called Independent Study (ECE 4900.pdf) that consists in the development of a project. The goal of this project was to upgrade the Air Hockey Table project. There were some issues in the first version of the project: the air flow was not strong enough to make the puck float and the scoring system was not working. Therefore, in this project I designed a scoring mechanism, upgraded airflow system, and display interface. I used a Raspberry Pi as an interface.
